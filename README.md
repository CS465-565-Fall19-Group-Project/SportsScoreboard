# SportsScoreboard

Custom sports scoreboard by Lane Barton and Alex Springer. See the site at [https://cs565sportsscoreboard.herokuapp.com/](https://cs565sportsscoreboard.herokuapp.com/)

## Outside Libraries Used

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) via [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for front end implementation
2. [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) for Bootstrap-like React components to improve styling
3. [React Router]() to handle internal page routering
4. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for Promise-based requests to handle API calls
5. [This thread by Akshay Easwaran and other individuals](https://gist.github.com/akeaswaran/b48b02f1c94f873c6655e7129910fc3b) for a primer on ESPN APIs. We actually found some alternative routes on our own, but this got us started

## Overview of Repo

All content is in the `src` folder and is organized as detailed below. Also don't forget to run `npm install` if you want to test it locally!

### `src/scripts`

This contains the work around API calls to ESPN. [apis.js](./src/scripts/apis.js) contains methods to make the calls and return data objects. [src/apis.js](./src/scripts/sdk/espn_classes.js) was an attempt to make classes out of the data object and provide some useful data since ESPN API calls return a LOT of data that is not very conveniently organized, inconsistent between different calls, and just downright hard to go through without some help. These classes are utilized but is not fully fleshed out because it was more work than necessary for some parts.

### React Components

The remainder of the work in the `src` folder are React components created to build the UI. A brief overview of important files and what they do are as follows:

1. [App.js](./src/App.js) holds the main body of the application which is loaded as the root element of the DOM.
2. [NavBar.js](./src/NavBar.js) renders the nav bar. It uses React Router to handle routes and render different components depending on the request route.
3. [Home.js](./src/Home.js) holds the scoreboard component. This is built as a two-tab component containing the [TeamSearch](./src/TeamSearch.js) and [Scoreboard](./src/Scoreboard.js) components which allows users to select teams they want to track and then view most recent games related to those teams
4. [Scoreboard.js](./src/Scoreboard.js) holds the component that renders score information based on teams selected in the [TeamSearch](./src/TeamSearch.js) component
5. [TeamSearch.js](./src/TeamSearch.js) holds functionality to search for and click teams to track. Tracked teams are passed to the [Scoreboard](./src/Scoreboard.js) component for rendering.
6. [Teams.js](./src/TeamSearch.js) holds for populating team cards for various sports teams. Clicking individual team cards sends you to additional information as represented in the [TeamInfo](./src/TeamInfo.js) component.
7. [TeamInfo.js](./src/TeamInfo.js) holds the component that renders detailed information for an individual team. This includes a full schedule and more statistics for the team

## `create-react-app` Auto-Generated Info

This was autogenerated upon running `npx create-react-app`. Some of the content, specifically the `npm start` documentation to run a local server, is useful so we are keeping it for posterity's sake

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
